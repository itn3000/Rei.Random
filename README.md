C# Random Number Library
========================

C# implementation of SFMT, written and maintained by Rei Hobara, and primarily hosted at [rei.to/random.html](http://rei.to/random.html).

All credit goes to the original authors of Mersenne Twister, and other algorithms. Thanks also to Rei for graciously re-coding the C into C#, and giving permission to publish her work on Nuget!

##Implemented Algorithms
*   Linear Congruential (LCG)
*   Mother of All
*   Mersenne Twister
*   SFMT
*   Xorshift
*   Well
*   Ranrot-B

##Todo List
1.  Add original unit tests to project.
2.  Sign assembly.
3.  Nant build script.
4.  Publish package on nuget.
